            <p>I was given the task of creating my own movie webpage with a partner to put our httml and css knowledge into use. The mock movie we created is shown below. </p>
            <p>The movie is about a fuan who struggles with loneliness and isolation. She wanders around, trying to find a place to belong. </p>

            ### Challenges
            <p>A challenge that me and my partner faced was distributing the work. We originally got so caught up choosing the content of the story and what we should do because we had different preferences and we were fine with whatever the other wanted. We had spent the entire first day doing that so when we went home we had not that much content. I had chosen roles for us to do, id do css while he does html. The issue was that we had some struggles with writing the story so there was no html and I wasn't able to do my job. To overcome these issues I decided I was going to swap roles and work on the html using "lorem ipsum" as filler text to see how the css would look like. My partner worked on writing the story, fishing the css, and making a logo. Overall we were still able to distribute the work and get the project finished early.</p>
            ### Takeaways
            * Work on communication
            * Plan on what to do first rather then planing on the content
            * Use your time efficiently
            ### Next Step
            <p>Next step to learn more css and html to improve my website coding abilities.</p>
